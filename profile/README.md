# Baramay Station Research Inc.
### Nonprofit Research Organization • Saskatchewan, Canada

Baramay Station Research Inc. is a Canadian nonprofit dedicated to early-stage exploration of advanced computing, cryptography, and distributed systems. Our work focuses on foundational research, prototyping, and open-science publication supporting future technologies in secure computation and digital infrastructure.

This GitHub organization hosts concept prototypes, research notes, and experimental software artifacts developed through Baramay Station’s ongoing exploratory work.

All repositories are non-production, non-functional, and intended solely for academic and experimental purposes.

## Current Research Themes

Baramay Station investigates broad areas of emerging technology, including:

- experimental post-quantum cryptography  
- distributed and mesh-based networking concepts  
- prototype virtual-machine models  
- early designs for verifiable computation  
- containerized research environments  
- digital-twin and simulation-aligned system sketches  

Research artifacts are exploratory and do not represent finalized or deployable systems.

## Active Repository Categories

The Baramay Station GitHub organization contains several categories of experimental work:

- **Concept Prototypes**  
  Early-stage sketches and idea exploration in code or mathematical form.

- **Cryptography Experiments**  
  Toy models, hashing tests, and prototype key-exchange concepts.

- **System Simulations**  
  Containerized or script-based environments for structural and conceptual testing.

- **Documentation & Whitepapers**  
  Research manuscripts, exploratory notes, and technical drafts.

All material is open-source and intended for learning, collaboration, and public review.
