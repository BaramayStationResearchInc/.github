**Sovereign Cryptographic Systems | Indigenous-led Quantum Infrastructure | Treaty 8 Territory, Canada**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **Baramay Station Research Inc.**, a nonprofit research initiative developing sovereign, post-quantum, and ethically grounded digital technologies. We design systems for a new era of decentralized trust, cryptographic independence, and resilient civilizational infrastructure.

## 🔐 Core Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[TetraKlein](https://github.com/Abraxas618/TetraKlein)** | A sovereign, post-quantum container OS with zkSNARK genesis, Yggdrasil mesh, and tesseract hashing |
| **[TetraYau](https://github.com/Abraxas618/TetraYau)** | Cryptographic benchmarking suite for TKE, QIDL, and RTH on commodity hardware |
| **TetraNav** | GPS-free inertial quantum mesh navigation system (phase-locked mesh positioning) |
| **TetraVote** | Secure voting infrastructure built on post-quantum cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs |
| **TetraCodex** | Ethical and sovereign AI + mesh consensus framework, including Codex Constitution & swarm protocols |

## 🧠 Mission

Baramay Station Research Inc. is dedicated to advancing **sovereign infrastructure** for Indigenous nations, academic researchers, and post-collapse scenarios. Our work blends cryptography, decentralized systems, recursive logic, and symbolic mathematics into deployable tools for:

- Digital self-governance
- Air-gapped, quantum-secure computing
- Autonomous AI agents with ethical alignment
- Post-GPS, trustless communication layers
- Mesh-based quantum voting and identity protocols

We operate under Treaty 8 and uphold **ethical compliance**, **non-weaponization**, and **post-quantum transparency**.
